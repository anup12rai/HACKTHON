In fact, onions are often used to add flavor and texture to curd.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some people might find the combination of curd and onions unappetizing or even untraditional, depending on their personal taste preferences or cultural background.\n\nUltimately, whether you can eat curd with onions depends on your personal taste buds and cultural norms. If you enjoy the combination, go for it! If not, there are many other delicious ways to enjoy curd."
